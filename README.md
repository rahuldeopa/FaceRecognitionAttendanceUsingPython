Face Recognition Attendance Using Python
Face recognition attendance using Python can be implemented using libraries such as OpenCV and dlib. The basic steps include:

Collecting and storing face images of individuals in a database
Extracting facial features from the stored images using OpenCV or dlib
Training a machine learning model on the extracted features
Capturing real-time images of individuals using a webcam
Extracting features from the real-time images
Using the trained model to predict the identity of the individual based on the extracted features
Marking the individual as present if their identity is successfully predicted.
It's important to note that, Face recognition is a complex task and it may not always work accurately, especially when the images are low-quality or if the individuals face is obscured.
